This is a recreation of my project from Freshman year of college. I originally did it in Java after learning about the concept of backtracking, but I ended up losing the files before learning about github...

It's a beautifully simple algorithm, and I think everyone who's getting into programming should try it out. It's a great application of recursion, so anyone who's trying to get more practice in that area should also try this out. 

The main program is in the SudokuSolver.py file. The input boards I put in a separate boards.py file to reduce clutter. If you want to use your own puzzles, I recommend adding it to the boards.py to keep things clean on the SudokuSolver side. I should probably use a .json file instead of a .py file for storing the boards, but that can be for a later time. It might be cool to look into computer vision to make it easier to input the puzzles into the solver, but that would also be a project for later.

Hope you learn something from this! I know I definitely did.
